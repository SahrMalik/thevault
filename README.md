This ongoing project is a small personal website that I will use to list topics, books, ideas & people
that I find interesting. It will function as a sort of personal archive of information that 
I can come back to whenever I want to further my research in a particular field. 

The aim of this project is not to showcase any coding skills or talents. It is a continuous project
for me to document what I am personally learning in my free time. For example, I take a great
interest in philosophy so I compile a list of books, authors, and people for me to look into in the 
future.
